# The Comparison Framework

![newton.jpg](newton.jpg)

## Introduction

This is the repository of the Comparison Framework, a blueprint for a system that is used to create structural physics models from measurement data.

If you have every asked yourself questions such as:

Why does the SI system look the way it looks? Why are there dimensions like length and time in physics equations? Where do they come from? Why can we do certain things with units like the meter and the second, and certain things not? Why can't we add them? How come there are composite units?

This system provides deep but rather simple answers to all such questions, and by doing so it also allows its client to create models from measurement data in a way that is logically sound.

## Copyright Information

The text and underlying material in this document is free to use, just as any other scientific work, under the ordinary rules of academic integrity. The images, however, are copyrighted by their creators (via Shutterstock) and can therefore not be used freely. It is allowed to download the document, and read it, and to keep copies, and to extract text, but it is not allowed to extract the images from the documents and to use them for other purposes, because that is in violation with the copyright policy of Shutterstock.

## Downloading and Versioning

The most recent document is always available in the [Releases section](https://github.com/androlo/comparison_framework/releases). 

The document is versioned, meaning you can always look at the front page of your document and compare the version with the version of the most recently published document to see if it is up to date. It will have the label "draft", and versions of the form 0.X.Y, until the first edition. Afterwards, it will have versions of the form X.Y.Z where X is the edition number (e.g., the first edition will have edition number 1). 

About the progress of the document: The first draft version that was made public had version 0.16.0, so if the current version is 0.18.5 at some point, that means the document has gone through two larger revisions and then five smaller fixes after that.

## About the State of the Document

This document is still considered a draft, and should be seen as containing a "beta version" of the framework.

## How to Report Errors

Use the issue tracker in this repository. There is no need to use alternative flags, just use the existing flags, e.g., if there is a typo then it can be flagged under documentation, or bug, either is fine.

## Overview of the Different Chapters and Their States

### Chapters 1 to 7

These chapters should be in mostly good order.

### Chapter 8

This is a chapter that speaks mostly about the SI system and some of its math, and it kind of sticks out from the rest of the document; however, it should be in good order.

### Chapter 9 and 10

These chapters should be in mostly good order.

### Chapter 11

This chapter should be in mostly good order, except it was added in rather recently.

### Chapter 12

This chapter should be mostly fine, but it is also rather new.

### Chapter 13

This is the most recent chapter, and will therefore likely have the most issues.

### Appendices

The "special unit functions" and "algebraic structures" appendices are still in progress. The protocol appendix has only been added in as a placeholder.

The proofs should be mostly sound, but could need some more massaging.
